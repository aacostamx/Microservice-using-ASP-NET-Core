Microservices
-------------

The term microservices portrays a software development style that has
grown from contemporary trends to set up practices that are meant to
increase the speed and efficiency of developing and managing software
solutions at scale. Microservices is more about applying a certain
number of principles and architectural patterns as architecture. Each
microservice lives independently, but on the other hand, also all rely
on each other. All microservices in a project get deployed in production
at their own pace, on-premise on the cloud, independently, living side
by side.

Microservices Architecture
--------------------------

The following picture from [Microsoft
Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices)
shows the microservices architecture style.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core.png) 

There are various components in a microservices architecture apart from
microservices themselves.

**Management**. Maintains the nodes for the service.

**Identity Provider**. Manages the identity information and provides
authentication services within a distributed network.

**Service Discovery**. Keeps track of services and service addresses and
endpoints.

**API Gateway**. Serves as client’s entry point. Single point of contact
from the client which in turn returns responses from underlying
microservices and sometimes an aggregated response from multiple
underlying microservices.

**CDN**. A content delivery network to serve static resources for e.g.
pages and web content in a distributed network

**Static Content** The static resources like pages and web content

Microservices are deployed independently with their own database per
service so the underlying microservices look as shown in the following
picture.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core02.png) 

 

Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture
----------------------------------------

Monolithic applications are more of a single complete package having all
the related needed components and services encapsulated in one package.

Following is the diagrammatic representation of monolithic architecture
being package completely or being service based.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core03.png) 

Microservice is an approach to create small services each running in
their own space and can communicate via messaging. These are independent
services directly calling their own database.

Following is the diagrammatic representation of microservices
architecture.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core04.png) 

In monolithic architecture, the database remains the same for all the
functionalities even if an approach of service-oriented architecture is
followed, whereas in microservices each service will have its own
database.

Docker Containers and Docker installation
-----------------------------------------

Containers like Dockers and others slice the operating system resources,
for e.g. the network stack, processes namespace, file system hierarchy
and the storage stack. Dockers are more like virtualizing the operating
system. Learn more about dockers
[here](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). Open
[this](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) URL and
click on Download from Docker hub. Once downloaded, login to the Docker
and follow instructions to install Docker for Windows.

Microservice using ASP.NET Core
-------------------------------

This section will demonstrate how to create a Product microservice using
ASP.NET Core step by step with the help of pictures. The service would
be built using ASP.NET Core 2.1 and Visual Studio 2017. Asp.NET Core
comes integrated with VS 2017. This service will have its own DBcontext
and database with the isolated repository so that the service could be
deployed independently.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core05.png) 

 

Creating an ASP.NET Core Application Solution
---------------------------------------------

1.  Open the Visual Studio and add a new project.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core06.png)\

2.  Choose the application as ASP.NET Core Web Application and give it a
    meaningful name.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core07.png)\

3.  Next, choose API as the type of the project and make sure that
    “Enable Docker Support” option is selected with OS type as Linux.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core08.jpg)\

4.  The solution will look as shown below.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core09.png)

Adding Models
-------------

1.  Add a new folder named “Model” to the project.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core10.png)\

2.  In the Models folder, add a class named Product.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core11.png)\

3.  Add a few properties like Id, Name, Description, Price to the
    product class. The product should also be of some kind and for that,
    a category model is defined and a CategoryId property is added to
    the product model.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core12.png)\

4.  Similarly, add Category model.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core13.png)\

Enabling EF Core
----------------

Though .NET Core API project has inbuilt support for EF Core and all the
related dependencies are downloaded at the time of project creation and
compilation that could be found under SDK section in the project as
shown below.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core14.png) 

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer (2.1.1) should be the package
inside the downloaded SDK’s. If it is not present, it could be
explicitly added to the project via Nuget Packages.

Adding EF Core DbContext
------------------------

A database context is needed so that the models could interact with the
database.

1.  Add a new folder named DBContexts to the project.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core15.png)\

2.  Add a new class named ProductContext which includes the DbSet
    properties for Products and Categories. OnModelCreating is a method
    via which the master data could be seeded to the database. So, add
    the OnModelCreating method and add some sample categories that will
    be added to the database initially into the category table when the
    database is created.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core16.png)\
    \
     **ProductContext code****\
    **
    1.  using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  
    2.  using ProductMicroservice.Models;  
    3.    
    4.  namespace ProductMicroservice.DBContexts  
    5.  {  
    6.    public class ProductContext : DbContext  
    7.    {  
    8.      public ProductContext(DbContextOptions\<ProductContext\> options) : base(options)  
    9.      {  
    10.     }  
    11.     public DbSet\<Product\> Products { get; set; }  
    12.     public DbSet\<Category\> Categories { get; set; }  
    13.   
    14.     protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)  
    15.     {  
    16.       modelBuilder.Entity\<Category\>().HasData(  
    17.           new Category  
    18.           {  
    19.             Id = 1,  
    20.             Name = "Electronics",  
    21.             Description = "Electronic Items",  
    22.           },  
    23.           new Category  
    24.           {  
    25.             Id = 2,  
    26.             Name = "Clothes",  
    27.             Description = "Dresses",  
    28.           },  
    29.           new Category  
    30.           {  
    31.             Id = 3,  
    32.             Name = "Grocery",  
    33.             Description = "Grocery Items",  
    34.           }  
    35.       );  
    36.     }  
    37.   
    38.   }  
    39. }  

3.  Add a connection string in the appsettings.json file.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core17.png)\

Open the Startup.cs file to add the SQL server db provider for EF Core.
Add the code services.AddDbContext\<ProductContext\>(o =\>
o.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("ProductDB"))); under
ConfigureServices method. Note that in the GetConnectionString method
the name of the key of the connection string is passed that was added in
appsettings file.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core18.jpg) 

Adding Repository
-----------------

Repository works as a micro component of microservice that encapsulates
the data access layer and helps in data persistence and testability as
well.

1.  Add a new folder named Repository in the project and add an
    Interface name IProductRepository in that folder. Add the methods in
    the interface that performs CRUD operations for Product
    microservice.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core19.png)\

2.  Add a new concrete class named ProductRepository in the same
    Repository folder that implements IProductRepository. All these
    methods need:\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core20.png)\

3.  Add the implementation for the methods via accessing context
    methods.\
     \
     **ProductRepository.cs**\
    1.  using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  
    2.  using ProductMicroservice.DBContexts;  
    3.  using ProductMicroservice.Models;  
    4.  using System;  
    5.  using System.Collections.Generic;  
    6.  using System.Linq;  
    7.    
    8.  namespace ProductMicroservice.Repository  
    9.  {  
    10.   public class ProductRepository: IProductRepository  
    11.   {  
    12.     private readonly ProductContext \_dbContext;  
    13.   
    14.     public ProductRepository(ProductContext dbContext)  
    15.     {  
    16.       \_dbContext = dbContext;  
    17.     }  
    18.     public void DeleteProduct(int productId)  
    19.     {  
    20.       var product = \_dbContext.Products.Find(productId);  
    21.       \_dbContext.Products.Remove(product);  
    22.       Save();  
    23.     }  
    24.   
    25.     public Product GetProductByID(int productId)  
    26.     {  
    27.       return \_dbContext.Products.Find(productId);  
    28.     }  
    29.   
    30.     public IEnumerable\<Product\> GetProducts()  
    31.     {  
    32.       return \_dbContext.Products.ToList();  
    33.     }  
    34.   
    35.     public void InsertProduct(Product product)  
    36.     {  
    37.       \_dbContext.Add(product);  
    38.       Save();    }  
    39.   
    40.     public void Save()  
    41.     {  
    42.       \_dbContext.SaveChanges();  
    43.     }  
    44.   
    45.     public void UpdateProduct(Product product)  
    46.     {  
    47.       \_dbContext.Entry(product).State = EntityState.Modified;  
    48.       Save();  
    49.     }  
    50.   }  
    51. }  

4.  Open the Startup class in the project and add the code as
    services.AddTransient\<IProductRepository, ProductRepository\>();
    inside ConfigureServices method so that the repository’s dependency
    is resolved at a run time when needed.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core21.jpg)\

Adding Controller
-----------------

The microservice should have an endpoint for which a controller is
needed which exposes the HTTP methods to the client as endpoints of the
service methods.

1.  Right click on the Controllers folder and add a new Controller as
    shown below.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core22.png)\

2.  Select the option “API Controller with read/write actions” to add
    the controller.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core23.png)\

3.  Give the name of the controller as ProductController.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core24.png)\

4.  A ProductController class will be added in the Controllers folder
    with default read/write actions that will be replaced later with
    product read/write actions and HTTP methods are created acting as an
    endpoint of the service.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core25.png)\

5.  ValuesController can be deleted as it is not needed.\
     \

6.  Add implementation to the methods by calling the repository methods
    as shown below. The basic implementation is shown here for the sake
    of understanding the concept. The methods could be attribute routed
    and could be decorated with more annotations as per need.\

Entity Framework Core Migrations
--------------------------------

Migrations allow us to provide code to change the database from one
version to another.

1.  Open Package Manager Console.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core27.png)\

2.  To enable the migration, type the command, Add-Migration and give
    that a meaningful name for e.g. InitialCreate and press enter.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core28.png)\

3.  Once the command is executed, if we look at our solution now, we see
    there's a new Migrations folder. And it contains two files. One, a
    snapshot of our current context model. Feel free to check the files.
    The files are very much self-explanatory.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core29.png)\

4.  To ensure that migrations are applied to the database there's
    another command for that. It's called the update-database If
    executed, the migrations will be applied to the current database.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core30.png)\

5.  Check the SQL Server Management Studio to verify if the database got
    created.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core31.png)\

6.  When data of the Categories table is viewed the default master data
    of three categories is shown.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core32.png)\

Run the Product Microservice
----------------------------

The service could be run via IIS Express i.e. Visual Studio default or
via Docker container as well.

Via IIS Express
---------------

Choose IIS Express in the Visual Studio as shown below and press F5 or
click that IIS Express button itself.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core33.jpg) 

The application will be up once the browser page is launched. Since it
has nothing to show, it will be blank, but the service could be tested
via any API testing client. Here Postman is used to testing the service
endpoints. Keep it opened and application running.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core34.png) 

Install Postman if it is not on the machine and launch it.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core35.png) 

 

**POST**

To test the POST method; i.e. create a new resource, select the method
as POST in postman and provide the endpoint, i.e.
https://localhost:44312/api/product and in the Body section, add a JSON
similar to having properties of Product model as shown below and click
on Send.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core36.png) 

The response is returned with the Id of the product as well.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core37.png) 

The “Post” method of the controller is responsible to create a resource
in the database and send the response.

The line return CreatedAtAction(nameof(Get), new { id=product.Id },
product); returns the location of the created resource that could be
checked in Location attribute in the response under Headers tab.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core38.png) 

Perform a select query on the product table and an added row is shown
for the newly created product.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core39.png) 

Create one more product in a similar way.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core40.png) 

 

**GET**

Perform a GET request now with the same address and two records are
shown as a JSON result response.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core41.png) 

 

**DELETE**

Perform the delete request by selecting DELETE as the verb and appending
id as 1 (if the product with id 1 needs to be deleted) and press Send.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core42.png) 

In the database, one record with Id 1 gets deleted.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core43.png) 

 

**PUT**

PUT verb is responsible for updating the resource. Select PUT verb,
provide the API address and in the Body section, provide details of
which product needs to be updated in JSON format. For example, update
the product with Id 2 and update its name, description, and price from
Samsung to iPhone specific. Press Send.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core44.png) 

Check the database to see the updated product.

![Microservice Using ASP.NET
Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core45.png) 

Via Docker Containers
---------------------

Running the service could be done via docker commands to be run in
docker command prompt and using visual studio as well. Since we added
the docker support, it is easy to run the service in docker container
using visual studio.

1.  Add container orchestrator support in the solution as shown below.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core46.jpg)\

2.  This will ask for the orchestrator. Select Docker Compose and press
    OK.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core47.jpg)\
     \
    Once added to the solution, the solution will look like shown below
    having docker-compose with dockerignore and docker-compose.yml and
    its override file.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core48.jpg)\
     \
    As soon as the solution is saved, it builds the project under the
    container and creates a docker image. All the commands execution can
    be seen in the output window when the solution is saved.

3.  Open the command prompt in admin mode and navigate to the same
    folder where the project files are.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core49.png)\

4.  Run the command docker images to see all the created images. We see
    the ProductMicroserviceimage the latest one.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core50.png)\

5.  Now run the application with Docker as an option as shown below.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core51.png)\

6.  Now, run the command docker ps to see the running containers. It
    shows the container is running on 32773:80 port.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core52.jpg)\

7.  Since the container is in running state, it is good to test the
    service now running under the container. To test the service,
    replace ”values” with “product” in the address as shown below.
    Ideally, it should get the product details. But it gives exception
    as shown below.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core53.png)\

8.  Running the same thing under IIS Express works fine i.e. on port
    44312. Replace “values” with the product to get the product
    details,\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core54.jpg)\

9.  Since in IIS Express application runs fine and not in docker
    container, the error clearly shows that something is wrong with the
    SQL server that it does not understand our docker container or it is
    not running under docker container. In this scenario, the docker
    container is running as a separate machine inside the host computer.
    So, to connect to the SQL database in the host machine, remote
    connections to SQL needs to be enabled. We can fix this.\
     \
10. Open the SQL Server Configuration Manager. Now select Protocols for
    MSSQLSERVER and get the IPAll port number under TCP/IP section.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core55.png)\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core56.png)\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core57.jpg)\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core58.png)\

11. The connection string mentioned in the JSON file points to the data
    source as local which the docker container does not understand. It
    needs proper IP addresses with port and SQL authentication. So,
    provide the relevant details i.e. Data Source as Ip address, port
    number and SQL authentication details as shown below.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core59.png)\

12. Now again run the application with Docker as an option like done
    earlier.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core60.jpg)\
     \
    This time the response is received.

13. Test the same in the Postman.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core61.png)\

14. Test again with IIS Express URL.\
     \
     ![Microservice Using ASP.NET
    Core](./Microservices%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core_files/Microservice%20Using%20ASP.NET%20Core62.jpg)\

This proves that the microservice is running on two endpoints and on two
operating systems independently locally deployed.

Conclusion
----------

A microservice is a service built around a specific business capability,
which can be independently deployed which is called bounded context.
This article on microservices focused on what microservices are and
their advantages over monolithic services architecture. The article in
detail described to develop a microservice using ASP.NET Core and run it
via IIS and Docker container. Likewise, the service can have multiple
images and could be run on multiple containers at the same point in
time.

Akhil, that was a wonderful write up and you just impacted a life in
Africa. However, I have TWO questions - (i) Where can I copy the right
connectionstring for the provider. For instance, i know that connection
string for ORACLE provider will be different from MS SQL SERVER. I feel
there should be an easy way to get the connectionstring (ii) Can you
make a tutorial to create another another microservice in conjucntion
with the one we did here and access their functionalities via API
Gateway. I know I am asking for a lot but a lot of people are certainly
waiting on you. Thanks for taking time to help a lot of people

Thanks for that interesting post. I don't agree with that statement:
"Microservices are deployed independently with their own database per
service". I have several API Microservice and all access the same
database(s). IMO there is no practical advantage to separate databases
for each microservice, further you would have tovdeal with several
connection strings, synchronizations, oprimistic concurrency
situations,etc.

You can configure the microservice in your own way to meet the business
objective. These are the protocols that need to be followed to escape
issues that can arise with application size being increased.
